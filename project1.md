Defend Your Homr!

"The wind whipped through my hair as I sprinted away from the place I used to call home. I could feel the scorching heat biting at my heels as I ran full speed down the hill toward the river. Part of me was urging my body forward, but the rest of me forced my head to turn and look behind at the carnage. I saw the wave of grey sweeping over the land, reducing everything to piles of dust and sand. The lush oasis I grew up in was crumbling before me. I felt my foot catch on a root and my entire body pitched forward as I tumbled to the ground. On the ground, and watching the destruction sweep ever closer I became too overwhelmed to move. I felt my arm being wrenched upward and my whole body followed up onto the back of my mother. She rushed me into the boat before hopping in herself. It didnâ€™t take long for me to notice the grey hue in her skin. I looked down and saw the pestilence had touched her foot and I began to weep. The Kuga had gotten her."

1. High Concept & Genre
  - In this emotional platforming adventure, you play as a young child, given the gift of transmutation by a mysterious being. 
You have been thrown into the role of the hero in order to rid your lush, green world of the Kuga by uncovering a lost weapon 
said to have repelled them years ago.
2. Platform
  - Desktop only
3. Story
  - The player comes from a lush and beautiful land that is being suddenly attacked by the Kuga who destroy everything beautiful in their path by 
turning it into grey dust.  The player's mother has fallen ill by being touched by the intial wave of grey that was released onto the land. The kuga 
are resistant to all forms of attack except electric shocks and are lead by the dictator Tito.  Your quest is to find the rod of storms to 
use against them and repel them out of your homeland.  To assist you a fairy has given the player the power to gain the properties of any material 
by simply touching.  Each level will progressively become less lush as the player gets further away from their homeland and closer to the heart 
of Kuga territory.
4. Esthetics
  - Graphics: Cartoonish 
  - Sound: Ambient forest sounds and looped peaceful music
    - The main sound will be from the enemies and players attacking. The player will have sound effects pertaining to what material they are mimicing 
    at the moment and the enemies will sound like slimes which squishing sound effects. Ambient forest sounds will play in the background that will 
    get quieter as the player gets further into the destroyed area
5. Gameplay
  - Mechanics
    - As  a platformer, the player will manuever mostly by jumping around the scene 
    - There will be different materials such as grass, water, fire, ice, rock, steel that the player can choose to interact with and can gain special 
    powers based on the material.  Grass will give the player a vine to swing between areas, water will allow them to slip through grates, fire will allow 
    them to shoot fire balls and burn wooden materials, etc.  If the player gets hit they will revert to their normal state and if they get hit in the normal state
    they will die and have to start the level over.
    - Puzzles will be made based on the use of different powers and such
    - Enemies will mostly attack from a range as well as coming into contact with one will injure the player.  The player cannot kill them
    but they can stun them by using certain powers or with a swing of their weapon, a stuffed chameleon.
    - The end of the level will be an orb that will move them to the next area
  - Control 
    - A,D: Right and left movement 
    - W: Jump
    - S: Fall through platforms
    - E: Attack
    - Q: Absorb material
    - SPACE: Use material power
  
  - Teaching
    - The first level of the game the player will follow the fairy around to learn basic controls then the fairy will give them the power to
  absorb materials and they will then be instructed on how to use that power.  This will serve as the tutorial level as well as some basic platforming/puzzle 
  solving.

  7. Other 
   - The buildings and architecture of the cities in this game are loosly based on croatia's cities and landscapes which are very lush and 
    beautiful.  Since most of the architecture, landscape, and names in this game are based on Croatia and the Croatian language, it is fitting to use Josif Tito as inspiration for the main enemy.  Tito was the communist leader of Yugoslav, which covered the area of Croatia and Bosnia, until his regime was defeated in Operation Storm. 
  The main quest of the game will be to find the rod of storms to use against him and push back the wave of grey.
